This text emerges from a series of reflections that led to the creation of [*Sarx*](/works/sarx.html), a piece I composed over the course of 2024. It was originally conceived as part of a book, where this text would serve as the first section, the second would be a work still in progress (a sound poem titled *Vox*), and the final part would be the piece *Sarx* itself. The version of this text I now present is a modification of the original, integrating specific reflections on *Sarx* . This adjustment aims to make the text function as an analysis of the piece. However, I decided not to alter its original format, which seeks to weave a conceptual and philosophical universe from relatively isolated reflections. This format, less academic in nature, allows the philosophical potency of the work to unfold. Thus, the resulting text is not a musicological study or analysis. On the contrary, it leans more toward a philosophical, perhaps literary, essay. Nevertheless, it is precisely this form of analysis that I find most fitting for engaging with the work that serves as this textâ€™s subject.
