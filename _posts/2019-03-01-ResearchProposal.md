This text is the research proposal I presented for a Master of Arts degree at the University of Huddersfield under the tutelage of Aaron Cassidy in 2019. Although I was accepted into the program, it unfortunately coincided with the onset of the pandemic, which led to the suspension of all support for studies abroad in Mexico. After two years of attempting to secure funding, I was unable to pursue this degree and ultimately had to relinquish the opportunity. Nevertheless, I remember this period of my creative practice as being highly active and enriching. While my creative path has since evolved, I still believe this research proposal holds significant artistic and philosophical value, making it an important milestone in my artistic journey.
