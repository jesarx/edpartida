*Sarx* is a piece for solo voice that explores the boundaries of the mouth, body, semantics, and notation systems. The work is composed entirely of glossolaliaâ€”sounds stripped of semantic meaning, existing purely as raw, intense vocal matter. It seeks to harness the full expressive power of the mouth and voice. The score, created with watercolor, abandons traditional pitch notation in favor of representing the movement of breath during inhalation and exhalation, as well as the varying intensities of tracheal pressure. Performing *Sarx* becomes a meditative experience, inviting the performer to engage with the voice and body in a decolonized, liberated way, unlocking their full sonic and poetic potential.

I also wrote a essay about this piece. It can be found [here](/works/writing).
