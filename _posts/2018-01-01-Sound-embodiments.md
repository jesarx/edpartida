This text emerged from a series of reflections on the body, music, and noise. In parallel with these writings—and partly as a result of them—I composed [*De cada poro resuelto de mi piel*](/works/de-cada-poro) and [*Verbo*](/works/verbo). These two pieces, along with the text, sought to rethink the performer’s body by creating stage performances centered on the performer’s personal experience of sound and movement. Although this is an earlier work, and I no longer fully align with all the ideas it expresses, it remains a significant part of my creative process. I choose to embrace it as a meaningful step on the journey that has shaped my artistic path.
